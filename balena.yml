  ## Usage instructions

  Note that [joining an Open Fleet](https://www.balena.io/blog/introducing-open-fleets-and-self-submitted-apps-and-blocks-on-balenahub/#join-fleet) does not require a balena account nor does it add the device to your personal balena dashboard. If you would rather manage your device and fleet directly you can [fork this fleet](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/klutchell/balena-adguard).

  1. Connect to `http://adguard.local` or if that doesn't work `http://YOUR-DEVICE-IP:80/install.html` in your browser
     - `YOUR-DEVICE-IP` should be the IP assigned via DHCP from your home router, you can find this IP in your router interface.
  
  2. Select `All interfaces` and port `80` for the Admin Web Interface listen interface
  
  3. Select either `eth0` or `wlan0` and port `53` for the DNS server listen interface
  
  4. Provide an admin username and password

  Documentation for Adguard Home can be found at <https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Getting-Started>

  It is recommended that you assign a static IP to your AdGuard Home device via you router or DHCP server if possible!
